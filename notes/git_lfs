for handling large files in git repo

# run this once a month in command line
git lfs install

#In each Git repository where you want to use Git LFS, select the file types you'd like Git LFS to manage (or directly edit #your .gitattributes). You can configure additional file extensions at anytime.

git lfs track "*.psd"

#Now make sure .gitattributes is tracked:

git add .gitattributes
#Note that defining the file types Git LFS should track will not, by itself, convert any pre-existing files to Git LFS, #such as files on other branches or in your prior commit history. To do that, use the *git lfs migrate* command, which has #a range of options designed to suit various potential use cases.

#There is no step three. Just commit and push to GitHub as you normally would; for instance, if your current branch is #named main:

git add file.psd
git commit -m "Add design file"
git push origin main
